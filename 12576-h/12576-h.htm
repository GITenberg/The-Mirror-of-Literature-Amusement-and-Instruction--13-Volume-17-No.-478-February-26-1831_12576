<h3>
	AUTOGRAPHS.
</h3>
<p>
It is long since our pages were illustrated with such characteristic
lineaments as those on the opposite page. The reader will, however,
perceive that we have not entirely forgotten the quaint motto from
Shenstone, in our earlier volumes&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I want to see Mrs. Jago's handwriting, that I may judge of her temper."
</p>
<p>
Still the annexed Autographs have not been drawn from our own portfolio:
they come "frae North," being selected from an engraved Plate of
forty-three signatures, published with No. 28 of the <i>Edinburgh
Literary Journal</i>, and prefixed to a pleasing chapter on "the
connexion between character and handwriting"&mdash;from which we select only
a few anecdotical traits.
</p>
<p>
ANNE GRANT: "We have given Mrs. Grant of Laggan's <i>present</i> hand,
in which may be discovered a little of the instability of advancing
life; but there is a well-rounded breadth and distinctness in the
formation of the letters, which seems to carry along with it evidence of
the clear and judicious mind of the talented authoress of 'Letters from
the Mountains.'"
</p>
<p>
D. STEWART:&mdash;"General Stewart of Garth, a free, bold, military hand;
his signature is taken from a letter complimenting in high terms Mr.
Chambers's History of the Rebellion of 1745."
</p>
<p>
ALLAN CUNNINGHAM:&mdash;an easy flow of tasteful handwriting. "Allan
Cunningham," observes the reviewer, "has raised himself like Hogg;
but, instead of the plough, he has handled the chisel; and there is
in his constitution an inherent love of the fine arts, which brings
his thoughts into more grateful channels. We are well aware that there
is a warmth and breadth of character about Cunningham which mark 'the
large-soul'd Scot;' but looking forward to his forthcoming Lives of the
British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, we do not conceive this
to be in the least inconsistent with the easy flow of his tasteful
handwriting."
</p>
<p>
F. HEMANS: "the very hand&mdash;fair, small, and beautifully feminine&mdash;in
which should be embodied her gentle breathings of household love, her
songs of the domestic affections, and all her lays of silvery sweetness
and soft-breathing tenderness."
</p>
<p>
F. LEVESON GOWER, the distinguished translator of Goëthe's Faust.
</p>
<p>
H. BROUGHAM: "a good deal like his own style of oratory&mdash;impressive and
energetic, but not very polished." We question the last; but, be this as
it may, polish is only desirable so long as it does not impair truth and
utility. Plain-speaking has been the best rule of conduct for public men
in all ages.
</p>
<p>
BASIL HALL: the observant traveller and very ingenious writer.
</p>
<p>
JOHN WILSON (the reputed editor of <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>); and
beneath, F. JEFFREY (late editor of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>), who
took his seat in Parliament not many days since.&mdash;"These are two names
which stand at the head of the periodical literature of Scotland. The
periodical writer must have a ready command of his pen and a versatile
genius; he must be able to pass quickly from one subject to another; and
instead of devoting himself to one continuous train of thought, he must
have a mind whose quick perception and comprehensive grasp enable him
to grapple with a thousand. See how this applies to the handwriting of
Jeffrey and of Wilson. The style of both signatures implies a quick and
careless motion of the hand, as if the writer was working against time,
and was much more anxious to get his ideas sent to the printer, than to
cover his paper with elegant penmanship. There is an evident similarity
in the fashion of the two hands&mdash;only Mr. Jeffrey, being much inferior
to the Professor in point of physical size and strength, naturally
enough delights in a pen with a finer point, and writes therefore a
lighter and more scratchy hand than the author of 'Lights and Shadows.'
It will add to the interest of Mr. Jeffrey's autograph to know that,
as his hand is not at all altered, we have preferred, as a matter of
curiosity, to engrave a signature of his which is twenty-three years
old, being taken from a letter bearing date 1806."
</p>
<p>
W. WORDSWORTH: "a good hand, more worthy of the author of the best
parts of 'The Excursion,' than of the puerilities of many of the Lyrical
Ballads."
</p>
<p>
DUGALD STEWART: "a hand worthy of a moral philosopher&mdash;large, distinct,
and dignified."
</p>
<p>
W. JERDAN: Editor of the <i>Literary Gazette</i>; free and facile as
his vein of criticism, and one of the finest signatures in the page.
</p>
<p>
J. BAILLIE: "it will be perceived that it has less of the delicate
feebleness of a lady's writing than any of the others. It would have
been sadly against our theory had the most powerful dramatic authoress
which this country has produced, written like a boarding-school girl
recently in her teens. This is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span>
decidedly not the case. There is something
masculine and nervous in Miss Baillie's signature; it is quite a hand in
which 'De Montfort' might be written."
</p>
<p>
PERCY B. SHELLEY: Free as its author's wild and beautiful poetry; but
it is not the hand of a very clear or accurate thinker.
</p>
<p>
THOMAS CHALMERS: "We know of few more striking examples of character
infusing itself into hand writing, than that presented by the autograph
of Dr. Chalmers. No one who has ever heard him preach, can fail to
observe, that the heavy and impressive manner in which he forms his
letters is precisely similar to the straining and energetic style in
which he fires off his words. There is something painfully earnest
and laborious in his delivery, and a similar sensation of laborious
earnestness is produced by looking at his hard pressed, though manly
and distinct, signature. It is in a small space, an epitome of one of
his sermons."
</p>
<p>
A. ALISON; the author of "Essays on Taste," and other works of sound
discrimination.
</p>
<p>
WASHINGTON IRVING; the graceful author of the "Sketch Book," free as a
crayon drawing, with all its exquisite light and shade.
</p>
<p>
JANE PORTER: "a fully more masculine though less tasteful hand than
Washington Irving, with whom she happens to be in juxtaposition; and
the fair authoress of "Thaddeus of Warsaw," and "the Scottish Chiefs"
certainly appears to have as masculine a mind as the elegant but perhaps
somewhat effeminate writer of "the Sketch Book."
</p>
<p>
W. TENNANT: full of originality, and in this resembles his own 'Anster
Fair.' The notion may be a fanciful one, but there seems to be a sort
of quiet humour in the writing, which makes its resemblance to 'Anster
Fair' still more complete. The principle upon which the letters are
formed is that of making all the hair strokes heavy, and all the heavy
strokes light."

<h3>
	HALCYON DAYS.
</h3>
<center>
(<i>To the Editor.</i>)
</center>
<p>
The following account of the origin and antiquity of Halcyon Days will,
I feel convinced, prove a valuable addition to that given by your
intelligent correspondent P.T.W., in No. 471 of <i>The Mirror</i>:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Halcyon Days, in antiquity, implied seven days before, and as many
after, the winter solstice&mdash;because the halcyon laid her eggs at this
time of the year, and the weather during her incubation being, as
your correspondent observes, usually calm. The phrase was afterwards
employed to express any season of transient prosperity, or of brief
tranquillity&mdash;the <i>septem placidae dies</i> of human life:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  The winter solstice just elapsed; and now</p>
           <p>  Silent the season, sad alcyone</p>
           <p>  Builds near the sleeping wave her tranquil nest.</p>
           <p style="text-align: right;">  <i>Eudosia.</i></p>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  When great Augustus made war's tempest cease,</p>
           <p>  His halcyon days brought forth the arts of peace.</p>
           <p style="text-align: right;">  <i>Dryden.</i></p>
</div></div>
<p>
The halcyon built her nest on the rocks adjacent to the brink of the
ocean, or, as some maintain, on the surface of the sea itself:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">                       Alcyone compress'd</p>
           <p>  Seven days sits brooding on her wat'ry nest,</p>
           <p>  A wintry queen; her sire at length is kind,</p>
           <p>  Calms every storm, and hushes every wind.</p>
           <p style="text-align: right;">  <i>Ovid, by Dryden.</i></p>
</div></div>
<p>
It is also said, that during the period of her incubation, she herself
had absolute sway over the seas and the winds:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  May halcyons smooth the waves, and calm the seas,</p>
           <p>  And the rough south-east sink into a breeze;</p>
           <p>  Halcyons of all the birds that haunt the main,</p>
           <p>  Most lov'd and honour'd by the Nereid train.</p>
           <p style="text-align: right;">  <i>Theocritus, by Fawkes.</i></p>
</div></div>
<p>
Alcyone, or Halcyone, we are informed, was the daughter of Aeolus (king
of storms and winds), and married to Ceyx, who was drowned in going to
consult an oracle. The gods, it is said, apprized Alcyone, in a dream,
of her husband's fate; and when she discovered, on the morrow, his body
washed on shore, she precipitated herself into the watery element, and
was, with her husband, metamorphosed into birds of a similar name, who,
as before observed, keep the waters serene, while they build and sit on
their nests.

	RANSOMS.
</h3>
<center>
(<i>To the Editor.</i>)
</center>
<p>
In a late number, you gave among the "County Collections," with which a
correspondent had furnished you, the old Cornish proverb&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  "Hinckston Down well wrought,</p>
           <p>  Is worth London dearly bought."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
Possibly your correspondent was not aware that the true reading of this
proverb is the following:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  "Hinckston Down well wrought,</p>
           <p>  Is worth a monarch's ransom dearly bought."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
The lines are thus quoted by Mr. Barrington, in his elaborate work on
the middle ages, and refer to the prevailing belief, that Hinckston Down
is a mass of copper, and in value, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>[pg 148]</span>
an equivalent for the price
set on the head of a captive sovereign. Perhaps, as some elucidation of
so intricate a subject as that of the ransoming prisoners during the
middle ages, the following remarks may not be deemed altogether unworthy
of insertion in your pages.
</p>
<p>
Originally, the supposed right of condemning captives to death rendered
the reducing of them to perpetual slavery an act of mercy on the part
of the conqueror, which practice was not entirely exploded even in
the fourteenth century, when Louis Hutin in a letter to Edward II. his
vassal and ally, desired him to arrest his enemies, the Flemings, and
make them slaves and serfs. (<i>Mettre par deveres vous, si comme
forfain à vous Sers et Esclaves à tous jours.</i>) <i>Rymer.</i> Booty,
however, being equally with vengeance the cause of war, men were not
unwilling to accept of advantages more convenient and useful than the
services of a prisoner; whose maintenance might be perhaps a burden to
them, and to whose death they were indifferent. For this reason even the
most sanguinary nations condescended at last to accept of ransom for
their captives; and during the period between the eleventh and fifteenth
centuries, fixed and general rules appear to have been established for
the regulating such transactions. The principal of these seem to have
been, the right of the captor to the persons of his prisoners, though in
some cases the king claimed the prerogative of either restoring them to
liberty, or of retaining them himself, at a price much inferior to what
their original possessor had expected. On a similar principle, Henry IV.
forbade the Percies to ransom their prisoners taken at Holmdown. In this
case the captives consisted of the chief Scottish nobility, and the king
in retaining them, had probably views of policy, which looked to objects
far beyond the mere advantage of their ransom. It is mentioned by a
French antiquary that the King of France had the privilege of purchasing
any prisoner from his conqueror, on the payment of 10,000 livres; and
as a confirmation of this, the money paid to Denis de Morbec for his
captive John, King of France, by Edward III. amounted to this exact
sum. The English monarch afterwards extorted the enormous ransom of
three millions of gold crowns, amounting, as it has been calculated,
to £1,500,000. of our present money, from his royal captive. The
French author censures Edward somewhat unjustly for his share in
this transaction; here as in the case of the Percies, state reasons
interfered with private advantages. John yielded up to his conquerors
not only the abovementioned sum, but whole towns and provinces became
the property of the English nation; to these De Morbec could have no
right. It was, however, notwithstanding the frequent mention in history
of ransoms, still in the power of the persons in possession of a
prisoner to refuse any advantage, however great, which his liberty might
offer them, if dictated by motives of policy, dependant principally on
his personal importance. Entius, King of Sardinia, son of Frederic II.
was esteemed of such consequence to his father's affairs, that the
Bolognese, to whom he became a prisoner in 1248, would accept of no
price for his manumission; and he died in captivity, after a confinement
of twenty-four years. Such was the conduct of Charles V. of France
towards the Captal de Buche, for whose liberty he refused all the offers
made to him by Edward III.
</p>
<p>
On this principle the Duke of Orleans and Comte d'Eu, were ordered by
the dying injunctions of Henry V. to be retained in prison until his
son should be capable of governing; nor was it until after a lapse of
seventeen years, that permission was given to these noblemen to purchase
their freedom.
</p>
<p>
If no state reason interfered, the conqueror made what profit he
could of his prisoners. Froissart, in speaking of Poictiers, adds,
that the English became very rich, in consequence of that battle,
as well by ransoms as by plunder, and M. St. Palaye, in his "Mem. sur
la Chevalrie," mentions that the ransom of prisoners was the principal
means by which the knights of olden time supported the magnificence for
which they were so remarkable. In the next century, the articles of war
drawn up by Henry V. previous to his invasion of France, contain the
condition, "that be it at the battle or other deeds of arms, where the
prisoners are taken, he that may first have his <i>Faye</i> shall have
him for a prisoner, and need not abide by him;" by Faye, probably the
promise given by the vanquished to his captor to remain his prisoner, is
understood; as the expression <i>donner sa foi</i>, occurs in various
French historians. The value of a ransom is sometimes estimated at one
year's income of a man's estate, and this opinion is supported by the
custom of allowing a year's liberty to captives to procure the sum
agreed upon. By the feudal law, every tenant or vassal was bound to
assist his lord in captivity, by
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span>
a contribution proportionate to the land
he held. As, however, the amount received for prisoners is very various,
personal importance had no doubt great weight in the determination of a
captive's value. Bertrand du Guescelin who had no property, valued his
own ransom at 100,000 livres; and Froissart, at the same period mentions
the ransom of a King of Majorca, of the house of Arragon, as being
exactly that sum.

Of the author of this song some account was given in a preceding number
of the <i>Mirror</i>. It was written on the same occasion as the <i>Patriot's
Call</i>, when Napoleon invaded Germany, and was intended to
tranquillize all petty feelings of jealousy between the separate German
states. The translator believes that Messrs. Treuttel and Würtz
published this song in an English dress some few years since; he has,

<h3>
	PLUNDER OF A SPANISH DILIGENCE.
</h3>
<center>
(<i>From the "Quarterly" Review, of "A Year in Spain." Unpublished.</i>)
</center>
<p>
The author takes his seat about two in the morning in the cabriolet
or front part of a diligence from Tarragona, and gives many amusing
particulars concerning his fellow travellers, who, one after another,
all surrender themselves to slumber. Thus powerfully invited by the
examples of those near him, the lieutenant catches the drowsy infection,
and having nestled snugly into his corner, soon loses entirely the
realities of existence "in that mysterious state which Providence has
provided as a cure for every ill." In short, he is indulged with a
dream, which transports him into the midst of his own family circle
beyond the Atlantic; but from this comfortable and sentimental nap he is
soon aroused by the sudden stopping of the diligence, and a loud clamour
all about him.
</p>
<p>
There were voices without, speaking in accents of violence, and whose
idiom was not of my country. I roused myself, rubbed my eyes, and
directed them out of the windows. By the light of a lantern that blazed
from the top of the diligence, I could discover that this part of the
road was skirted by olive-trees, and that the mules, having come in
contact with some obstacle to their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>[pg 150]</span>
progress, had been thrown into
confusion, and stood huddled together, as if afraid to move, gazing upon
each other, with pricked ears and frightened aspect. A single glance to
the right-hand gave a clue to the mystery. Just beside the fore-wheel of
the diligence stood a man, dressed in that wild garb of Valencia which
I had seen for the first time in Amposta: his red cap, which flaunted
far down his back, was in front drawn closely over his forehead;
and his striped manta, instead of being rolled round him, hung
unembarrassed from one shoulder. Whilst his left leg was thrown forward
in preparation, a musket was levelled in his hands, along the barrel of
which his eye glared fiercely upon the visage of the conductor. On the
other side the scene was somewhat different. Pepe (the postilion) being
awake when the interruption took place, was at once sensible of its
nature. He had abandoned the reins, and jumped from his seat to the
road-side, intending to escape among the trees. Unhappy youth, that
he should not have accomplished his purpose! He was met by the muzzle
of a musket when he had scarce touched the ground, and a third ruffian
appearing at the same moment from the treacherous concealment of the
very trees towards which he was flying, he was effectually taken, and
brought round into the road, where he was made to stretch himself upon
his face, as had already been done with the conductor.
</p>
<p>
I could now distinctly hear one of these robbers&mdash;for such they
were&mdash;inquire in Spanish of the mayoral as to the number of passengers:
if any were armed; whether there was any money in the diligence; and
then, as a conclusion to the interrogatory, demanding <i>La bolsa!</i> in
a more angry tone. The poor fellow meekly obeyed: he raised himself
high enough to draw a large leathern purse from an inner pocket,
and stretching his hand upward to deliver it, said, <i>Toma usted,
caballero, pero no me quita usted la vida!</i> "Take it, cavalier; but
do not take away my life!" The robber, however, was pitiless. Bringing
a stone from a large heap, collected for the repair of the road, he
fell to beating the mayoral upon the head with it. The unhappy man sent
forth the most piteous cries for <i>misericordia</i> and <i>piedad</i>.
He might as well have asked pity of that stone that smote him, as of the
wretch who wielded it. In his agony he invoked <i>Jesu Christo, Santiago
Apostol y Martir, La Virgin del Pilar</i>, and all those sacred names
held in awful reverence by the people, and the most likely to arrest the
rage of his assassin. All in vain: the murderer redoubled his blows,
until, growing furious in the task, he laid his musket beside him, and
worked with both hands upon his victim. The cries for pity which blows
at first excited, blows at length quelled. They had gradually increased
with the suffering to the most terrible shrieks; then declined into low
and inarticulate moans; until a deep-drawn and agonized gasp for breath,
and an occasional convulsion, alone remained to show that the vital
principle had not yet departed.
</p>
<p>
It fared even worse with Pepe, though, instead of the cries for pity,
which had availed the mayoral so little, he uttered nothing but low
moans, that died away in the dust beneath him. One might have thought
that the extreme youth of the lad would have ensured him compassion; but
no such thing. The robbers were doubtless of Amposta; and, being known
to him, dreaded discovery. When both the victims had been rendered
insensible, there was a short pause, and a consultation in a low tone
between the ruffians, who then proceeded to execute their plans. The
first went round to the left side of the diligence, and, having unhooked
the iron shoe and placed it under the wheel, as an additional security
against escape, opened the door of the interior, and mounted on the
steps. I could hear him distinctly utter a terrible threat in Spanish,
and demand an ounce of gold from each of the passengers. This was
answered by an expostulation from the Valencian shopkeeper, who said
that they had not so much money, but what they had would be given
willingly. There was then a jingling of purses, some pieces dropping on
the floor in the hurry and agitation of the moment. Having remained
a short time at the door of the interior, he did not come to the
cabriolet, but passed at once to the rotunda. Here he used greater
caution, doubtless from having seen the evening before, at Amposta,
that it contained no women, but six young students, who were all stout
fellows. They were made to come down, one by one, from their strong
hold, deliver their money and watches, and then lie flat upon their
faces in the road.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the second robber, after consulting with his companion,
returned to the spot where the zagal Pepe lay rolling from side to side.
As he went towards him, he drew a knife from the folds of his sash, and
having opened it, placed one of his naked legs on either
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>[pg 151]</span>
side of his
victim. Pushing aside the jacket of the youth, he bent forward and dealt
him repeated blows in every part of the body. The young priest, my
companion, shrunk back shuddering into his corner, and hid his face
within his trembling fingers; but my own eyes seemed spell-bound, for
I could not withdraw them from the cruel spectacle, and my ears were
more sensible than ever. Though the windows at the front and sides were
still closed, I could distinctly hear each stroke of the murderous
knife, as it entered its victim. It was not a blunt sound as of
a weapon that meets with positive resistance, but a hissing noise, as
if the household implement, made to part the bread of peace, performed
unwillingly its task of treachery. This moment was the unhappiest of my
life; and it struck me at the time, that if any situation could be more
worthy of pity, than to die the dog's death of poor Pepe, it was to be
compelled to witness his fate, without the power to aid him.
</p>
<p>
Having completed the deed to his satisfaction, this cold-blooded
murderer came to the door of the cabriolet, and endeavoured to open it.
He shook it violently, calling to us to assist him; but it had chanced
hitherto, that we had always got out on the other side, and the young
priest, who had never before been in a diligence, thought, from the
circumstance, that there was but one door, and therefore answered the
fellow that he must go to the other side. On the first arrival of these
unwelcome visitors, I had taken a valuable watch which I wore from my
waistcoat pocket, and slipped it into my boot; but when they fell to
beating in the heads of our guides, I bethought me that the few dollars
I carried in my purse might not satisfy them, and replaced it again in
readiness to be delivered at the shortest notice. These precautions
were, however, unnecessary. The third ruffian, who had continued to
make the circuit of the diligence with his musket in his hand, paused
a moment in the road a-head of us, and having placed his head to the
ground, as if to listen, presently came and spoke in an under tone to
his companions. They stood for a moment over the mayoral, and struck his
head with the butts of their muskets, whilst the fellow who had before
used the knife returned to make a few farewell thrusts, and in another
moment they had all disappeared from around us.
</p>
<p>
In consequence of the darkness, which was only partially dispelled in
front of the diligence by the lantern, which had enabled me to see what
occurred so immediately before me, we were not at once sensible of the
departure of the robbers, but continued near half an hour after their
disappearance in the same situation in which they left us. The short
breathings and the chattering of teeth, lately so audible from within
the interior, gradually subsided, and were succeeded by whispers of the
females, and soon after by words pronounced in a louder tone; whilst our
mangled guides, by groans and writhings, gave evidence of returning
animation.
</p>
<p>
Our first care, when thus left to ourselves, was to see if anything
could be done for our unfortunate guides. We found them rolling over in
the dust, and moaning inarticulately, excepting that the conductor would
occasionally murmur forth some of those sainted names whose aid he had
vainly invoked in the moment of tribulation. Having taken down the light
from the top of the coach, we found them so much disfigured with bruises
and with blood, that recognition would have been impossible. The finery
of poor Pepe, his silver buttons and his sash of silk, were scarcely
less disfigured than his features. There happened to be in our party a
student of medicine, who now took the lead in the Samaritan office of
binding, with pieces of linen and pocket handkerchiefs, the wounds of
these unhappy men.
</p>
<p>
The wounded men were at length placed in a cart, and sent back slowly
to Amposta, the mayoral showing some signs of returning sensibility,
but the unfortunate Pepe evidently in his last agony. The diligence
proceeded on its route, and stopped to breakfast at Vinaroz.
</p>
<p>
The kitchen of the posada at Vinaroz offered a scene of unusual
confusion. The hostess was no other than the mother of Pepe, a very
decent-looking Catalan woman, who, I understood, had been sent there the
year before by the Diligence Company, which is concerned in all the inns
at which their coaches stop throughout the line. She had already been
told of the probable fate of her son, and was preparing to set off for
Amposta in the deepest affliction; and yet her sorrow, though evidently
real, was singularly combined with her habitual household cares. The
unusual demand for breakfast by fourteen hungry passengers had created
some little confusion, and the poor woman, instead of leaving these
matters to take care of themselves, felt the force of habit, and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>[pg 152]</span>
was
issuing a variety of orders to her assistant; nor was she unmindful
of her appearance, but had already changed her frock and stockings,
and thrown on her mantilla, preparatory to departure. It was indeed a
singular and piteous sight to see the poor perplexed woman changing some
fish that were frying, lest they should be burnt on one side, adjusting
and repinning her mantilla, and sobbing and crying all the while. When
the man came, however, to say that the mule was in readiness, every
thing was forgotten but the feelings of the mother, and she hurried
off in deep and unsuppressed affliction.
</p>
<p>
We may as well add here the catastrophe of this tragical tale. From
information received by the Lieutenant, after his arrival in Madrid, it
appears that poor Pepe breathed his last about eight hours after the
attack, and long before his widowed mother could arrive to close the
eyes of her child. The mayoral lingered for about a week, and then
shared the fate of Pepe. The three robbers were detected and taken into
custody; two of them were townsmen, and all three acquaintances of Pepe,
whom they had doubtless murdered to prevent discovery. We ourselves
passed over the scene of the robbery between two and three years after
the event: there were two crosses to mark the bloody spot. The mayoral
and the zagal of our diligence, the successors of those who had been
murdered, pointed to the crosses with the <i>sang froid</i> with which
Spaniards, from long habitude, contemplate mementos of the kind. The
mayoral showed the very place where his predecessor had been beaten to
death. On our expressing horror at the detail he readily concurred,
though he appeared more indignant at the manner in which the crime had
been committed than at the crime itself. "It is the ugliest thing (<i>lo
mas feo</i>) that has been done in this neighbourhood for a long time
past. Look you, sir, to shoot a man with a blunderbuss, or to stab him
with a knife, is quite another kind of business; but to beat his brains
out with a stone is to treat him, not like a Christian, but a dog!" It
was evident that a frequent occurrence of such scenes had rendered the
mayoral a critic in the art of murder.

<i>History of the District of Gower, &amp;c.</i>
</center>
<p>
The peninsula which forms the western extremity of the county of
Glamorgan is called Gower, derived from the Welsh <i>Gwyr</i>. The
circumference of the district is about fifty miles: a slight reference
to the map will explain its peculiar form better than any description we
could give. The northern boundary extended east from the river Nedd, or
Neath (of course including Swansea) to the Loughor, which runs into the
large estuary, called the Burry River, and forms its western boundary,
dividing the counties of Glamorgan and Carmarthen.
</p>
<p>
The history of Gower is interesting. It may not be out of place,
however, to preface it with an outline of the history of Glamorgan.
This county was conquered by the Romans, who had numerous stations in
different parts, and also in the district of Gower, the traces of which
still exist. Glamorgan is originally supposed to have extended from the
river Tawy to Gloucester Bridge, including, besides the present county,
the whole of Monmouthshire, and portions of the counties of Brecon,
Hereford, and Gloucester. The Welsh princes of Glamorgan commenced
paying tribute to the English in the reign of Edgar,&mdash;which was
the cause of endless aggressions and disputes between them and the
independent princes of North Wales, who claimed this right. The county
was made a conquest about the end of the eleventh century, by Sir Robert
Fitzhamon (a relation of Henry I.) whose aid had been first called in by
one of the petty princes of Glamorgan, in some of the intestine feuds
which agitated South Wales. Fitzhamon, after entirely defeating the
Welsh, kept Cardiff Castle and the surrounding district in his own
possession, and divided the rest of the county amongst twelve Norman
knights, his principal followers&mdash;between whom and the inhabitants of
the hills there long existed a sort of Guerilla warfare. The Normans
were almost obliged to confine themselves to their castles in
consequence; and the Welsh joined Owen Glendower, when he invaded
Glamorgan, for which they afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>[pg 153]</span>
suffered heavily. It was not till
the reign of Henry VIII. that Wales became tranquillized.
</p>
<p>
The population of the county of Glamorgan, in 1821, comprised 101,727
persons.
</p>
<p>
To return to Gower. The first English or Norman conqueror of this
lordship was Henry de Newburgh, Earl of Warwick, who, in the reign
of Henry I. (1099), progressively defeated and drove out the sons of
Caradoc ap Jestyn, the Welsh possessors of Gower; and to secure his
conquest, built the castles of Swansea, Loughor, Llanridian, Penrice,
&amp;c. He is represented, like most of the feudal barons, as ruling with
an iron hand. A few years after this conquest (1108), the peninsula
was settled by a colony of Flemings, who had been obliged to emigrate,
in consequence of a disastrous encroachment of the sea in the Low
Countries. They first landed on the southern coast of England; but, on
account of their lawless conduct, Henry I. drove them into South Wales;
and they principally fixed themselves in Gower, where they became
peaceable subjects; though a great number settled in the peninsula of
Castle Martin, in Pembrokeshire, which bears a striking similarity in
its natural features to Gower. Afterwards they mixed with the English,
preserving their native manners and industry, and involved in disputes
with the Welsh resembling the ancient Border warfare in the North. To
this day the inhabitants of Gower are distinct from the Welsh, and all
speak the English language. We were informed, and it is a remarkable
fact, that in the south-western portion of Gower, some of the
descendants of the original colonists exist, who do not understand
the Welsh language, rarely intermarry with them, and are otherwise
distinguished by their dress and peculiar dialect. These people, who
have thus successively, for more than seven centuries, preserved almost
unmingled the manners of their progenitors, manufacture lace of the
same fabric as that of Flanders. In the reign of Henry II. Thomas de
Newburgh, son of Henry Earl of Warwick, the conqueror of Gower, parted
with the lordship to the crown. King John, in the fourth year of his
reign, granted the "whole land of Gower" to one of his favourites,
William de Braose, created Lord of Gower, "to be held by the service
of one knight's fee" and it continued in his family till the reign
of Edward II. It afterwards passed, by marriage, to Sir Charles
Somerset, an ancestor of the Duke of Beaufort, who now is hereditary
lord paramount of the liberty of seignory of Gower, and possesses
considerable property therein. Gower had distinct privileges, and was
separate from Glamorgan till the reign of Henry VIII., when, by act of
parliament, it was annexed to that county.
</p>
<p>
Gower is rich in memorials of the olden times, as will appear by the
sequel to the present paper&mdash;those strongholds of ancient despotism,
which, by their very ruin, tell of the nothingness of man's power and
ambition. We append the following observations of Mr. Britton, who has
done more to make the study of antiquities popular, it has been truly
observed, than all other antiquaries, past and present, put together.
They do honour to his head and heart. After stating that "the subject is
replete with amusement on all occasions, and intense interest on many,"
the author goes on: "I will venture to entreat my countrymen, whenever
and wherever they have power, to protect the remaining antiquities from
further demolition or defacement. Every castle, abbey, cathedral, fine
church, and old mansion, is a monument and memento of a former age, and
of former persons;&mdash;they are so many indexes to memorable events, to
heroes, statesmen, patriots, and philosophers. Architectural antiquities
are objects and evidences of incalculable value and interest; whilst
standing&mdash;however mutilated&mdash;they are indications of the vicissitudes
and fluctuations of civilized society;&mdash;they show man in his domestic
economy, and in his historical relations. The person, therefore, who
protects one fine work of antiquity, is entitled to the applause of
his contemporaries, and of posterity;&mdash;he who destroys, or heedlessly
neglects it, deserves the reprobation of the civilized world. As Dr.
Stukely indignantly hung, in graphic effigy, the man who wantonly broke
up the vast and wondrous Celtic Temple of Abury, so every other similar
delinquent should be condemned to the literary gibbet. The miserable
fanatic who fired York Cathedral is properly incarcerated for life, and
thus prevented from doing further public mischief; but there are other
fanatics still roaming at large, and permitted to commit devastations on
cathedrals and other churches&mdash;on castles, old mansions, &amp;c." "Such men,
should not be trusted."

	ST. NEW-YEAR'S DAY.
</h3>
<p>
This is a local custom, very faithfully kept in many parts of the
two northern counties. Early in the morning of the first of January,
the <i>Fax-populi</i> assemble together, carrying <i>stangs</i> and baskets.
Any inhabitant, stranger, or whoever joins not this ruffian tribe in
sacrificing to their favourite Saint Day, if unfortunate enough to be
met by any of the band, is immediately mounted across the stang (if a
woman, she is basketed), and carried, shoulder high, to the nearest
public-house, where the payment of sixpence immediately liberates the
prisoner. No respect is paid to any person; the cobbler on that day
thinks himself equal to the parson, who generally gets mounted like
the rest of his flock; whilst one of his porters <i>boasts and prides
himself</i> in having but just before got the <i>'Squire</i> across the pole.
None, though ever so industriously inclined, are permitted to follow
their respective avocations on that day.

	ORIGIN OF THE PINE CALLED WHITE-HART SILVER.
</h3>
<p>
Blackmoor Forest, at the spring of the Froome, was once called the
Forest of White Hart, and at that time the seat of royalty, and greatly
preferred by our kings, on account of the deer with which it abounded.
King Henry III., with a mighty train of hunters, having one day entered
on the chase in this neighbourhood, roused a milk-white hart. The
creature afforded his Majesty so much sport, that at the pulling down,
it was the royal pleasure to save the beast, and place round his neck a
collar of brass, on which was engraved,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  "I am a royal hart, let no one harm me."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
But the king and his retinue having run over and spoiled the lands of a
gentleman of the county, named <i>Thomas de la Linde</i>, and refusing, upon
remonstrance, to make good the injury, <i>De la Linde</i> imprudently
resolved to spite King Henry; when, joining with others, he hunted the
white hart, and having run it down, foolishly took the life of the
king's favourite; and making merry over its haunches, was heard in his
cups to utter many disrespectful speeches towards his sovereign, which
were conveyed to Henry, who presently convinced <i>De la Linde</i> of his
presumption, and so highly resented the indignity, that he made every one
concerned in the death of the noble animal pay into his exchequer an
annual fine, called "White Hart Silver," which was not remitted during
the reign of that monarch. This is also the origin of the White Hart
for a sign at the different inns and houses of entertainment throughout
England.

	WHITSUNTIDE IN GLOUCESTERSHIRE.
</h3>
<p>
One of the most strange customs which time has handed down to us,
prevails at St. Briavel's, in Gloucestershire. On Whit Sunday, several
baskets full of bread and cheese, cut into small squares of about an
inch each, are brought into the church; and immediately after divine
service is ended, the churchwardens, or some other persons, take them
into the galleries, from whence their contents are thrown amongst the
congregation, who have a grand scramble for it in the body of the
church, which occasions as great a tumult and uproar as the amusement of
a village wake, the inhabitants being always extremely anxious in their
attendance at worship on this day.
</p>
<p>
This custom is held for the purpose of preserving to the poor of St.
Briavel's and Hewelfield, the right of cutting and carrying away wood
from three thousand acres of coppice land, in Hudknolls and the Meends;
and for which every housekeeper is assessed twopence, to buy the bread
and cheese given away.

<h3>
	DRESSING THE CHRISTMAS TREE IN GERMANY.
</h3>
<center>
(<i>From a Correspondent.</i>)
</center>
<p>
This is performed with great ceremony and mystery, on Christmas Eve,
by the elders of the family, without the knowledge of the younger
members. They deck a large evergreen with presents of various kinds:
to toys, bonbons, and such trifles, are added things of more value and
use&mdash;working materials for the girls, knives, &amp;c. for the boys, and
books of amusement and instruction for both. Little tapers are attached
to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
branches of the shrub; and at break of day the children are
roused from their slumber, and when all are ready (for no one is allowed
to enter singly) they are admitted into the room, where the illuminated
tree greets their eyes. Great is the anxiety of the young party to see
who has been provided for, since the idea they are taught to entertain
is, that these tempting objects are bestowed by an invisible agent, as
a reward for good children, and that the naughty and ill-conducted will
find no share allotted to them.
</p>
<p>
Hêbel, in one of his pretty, simple poems, describes a mother sitting by
her sleeping child, as she prepares its morning surprise. She enumerates
the various gifts she hangs on the tree, pausing in her pleasing task as
a moral reflection is suggested by any of the objects she has collected,
and concluding by a prayer for the future welfare of her darling.
Would not the Christmas-tree be a pleasant addition to our juvenile
amusements? The Twelfth-night King and Queen might plant such a one
in their royal domain, and graciously conclude their merry reign by
distributing amongst those who have served them as liege subjects for
the evening, the motley <i>fruits</i> that grace it. Each should be
previously marked to correspond with the character to be drawn, which
would secure a token of their majesties' favour for each individual of
the sportive train.

	SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS.
</h2>
<hr />
<h3>
	ST. JOHN LONG
</h3>
<p>
Has distanced the majesty of British justice in the persons of the
coroner, the bailiffs, and the Bow-street magistrates, after all. We
knew that he would do so; but in this we take no possible credit to
ourselves, for every one knew that he would do so. Public opinion is,
we must confess, still divided as to the place of his retreat, some
pronouncing it America, where his purpose is, to set up a bank with
Rowland Stephenson; others, New South Wales, by a natural and pleasant
anticipation; and others, Paris, which of late years has superseded
Philadelphia, and even New York, as the general receptacle of "the
unfortunate brave," the asylum of those men of genius, who have too much
talent to live in England, the favoured spot of regeneration for those
brilliant speculators whose conceptions equally outrun their credit and
their age. However, the majority are clearly for Paris; and the objects
of the visit are said to be political, and not personal. The friends of
the ex-ministers, it is understood, have succeeded in engaging him;
and he is about to put in operation a very extensive system of
<i>counter-irritation</i> among the <i>canaille</i> of the French capital.
Should his exertions be attended with success, he will, on his return,
be retained by the Home-office, and despatched into the disturbed
districts to <i>counter-irritate</i> the erring disciples of "Swing."
</p>
<p>
On the whole, we are convinced that St. John Long will be seriously
missed at the West-end. His house was a pleasant lounge; his chocolate
was unimpeachable, whatever his honesty might be; no one could ever
question the strength of his coffee, whatever might be surmised of his
science; and the sandwiches which promenaded the rooms regularly every
half-hour, were a triumphant answer to all the aspersions that his
patients lived upon air. We have no doubt that it was a much pleasanter
place than the bazaars, to which such hosts of old peeresses order their
carriages every day at one, with such matchless punctuality, to buy
sixpence-worth of ribbon, and kill three hours. To this, St. John Long's
promenade was a paradise. The comfortable manner in which all the
comforts of the old ladies were provided for; the pleasantries arising
from the nature of the scene between the various <i>rubbed</i>: the
files of young women, with their mouths fixed to gas-pipes, and imbibing
all sorts of vapours; and, never to be forgotten in the catalogue of
attractions, the men of all ages who came to learn the art of being
cured of all calamities, that of the purse inclusive. Then, too, St.
John's own judicious generosity; the presents of invaluable snuff, of
first-growth Champagne, of Mocha coffee to one, and of gunpowder tea to
another, showed a knowledge of women and human nature, that must, but
for the malice of justice, inevitably have led to fortune. What will now
become of the countess, who led her daughters to this palace of Hygeia
as regularly as the day came; and with a spirit worthy of the great
cause, declared that, if she had twenty daughters, she would take every
one of them every day to the same place, for the same rubbing? What
will become of the heavy hours of him who declared St. John's gas a
qualification for the Cabinet, and that a sick minister applying to this
dispenser of all virtue, would be on his legs in the House, and making
a victorious speech
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page156" name="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>
within the twenty-four hours? What will become of
the battalion of beauties who, at every puff of the gas-pipe, ran to
their mirrors, and received the congratulations of the surrounding
dandies, or the revived carnation of their cheeks? "Othello's
occupation's o'er." But a St. John Long, of some kind or other, is
so essential to the West-end world, that a successor must be rapidly
erected in his room. Every age has its St. John Long, formed by the
mere necessities of the opulent and idle. A new Perkins, with a packet
of metallic tractors on a new scale would be extremely acceptable in
any handsome street in the neighbourhood of Grosvenor-square. Animal
magnetism would thrive prodigiously between this and the dust-months,
when London is left to the guardsmen and the cab-drivers; and when, as
Lady Jersey says, nobody who is anybody is to be seen in the streets
from morning till night, that is, from three till six. But the true
man of success would be Dr. Graham, of famous memory; the heir of his
talents would make a fortune in any season of the year; and now that
St. John Long has vacated the throne, nothing could be more favourable
for his ambition, than to take advantage of the interregnum, and make
himself monarch of charlatanry without loss of time.&mdash;From "Notes of
the Month," by far the most piquant portion of the <i>Monthly Mag</i>.

<h3>
THE LATE MADAME DE GENLIS.
</h3>
<p>
The following smart account of the late Madame de Genlis, is translated
from that very piquant French paper the Figaro of the 4th January:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
She nearly died the day she came into the world; a mere chance saved
her; and the noble lady lived eighty-five years. What a misfortune, not
only for the Ducrest and the Genlis, if the clumsy Bailiff who sat down
in the arm-chair where the infant prodigy had been left by the careless
nurse, had crushed under the ample and heavy developement of his various
femoral muscles, the hope of French literature! The concussion would
have despoiled us of a hundred volumes, and Heaven can witness what
volumes! History in romances; morality in proverbs; and religion in
comedies. This is what the world of letters would have lost,&mdash;society
would have lost a very different thing.
</p>
<p>
Such a nose as never was possessed before; a nose modelled by Love
himself, and celebrated by ten court poets, and which the censer of
praise was as
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>
unable to improve as a certain tumble which its owner had
in infancy. Hands the most beautiful that could be, and which Madame de
Genlis put up for exhibition during twenty years, upon the strings of
a harp, now passed into a proverb. A form without fault, and which made
the delight of the Palais Royal parties in the open air. A foot, alike
triumphant at the Court and at the <i>Porcherons</i>. Eyes capable of
making an impression upon the running footman of M. de Brancas, and of
an innumerable crowd of dukes, lawyers, officers, and men of letters.
A genius!&mdash;oh! for her genius, if she had not been encumbered with
so much modesty, Madame de Genlis would have shone by it alone in the
<i>first</i> rank; through feminine modesty she remained in the second.
</p>
<p>
Philosophy may breathe again. The author of "The Evenings at the Castle"
was the Attila of philosophers;&mdash;she crushed Voltaire, considering him
as a <i>mauvais sujet</i>; pursued Diderot and d'Alembert; breasted
Rousseau; refuted the Encyclopaedia; and was always of the party in
favour of the Altar and the Throne, excepting only the clay when the
revolution of 1789 commenced.
</p>
<p>
Foul-mouthed people allege Madame de Genlis to have been a great
coquette, which, is a calumny. She was virtue itself. No doubt she was
the object of rude assaults; public declarations, scenes of despair,
disguises, eulogies in verse, madrigals in prose&mdash;all were employed to
seduce her affections; but she resisted always. To revenge her cruelty,
they attacked her morals, and epigrams rained on her. She replied by
her Memoirs&mdash;rather diffuse confessions, which Lavocat (the publisher)
contrived to dilute further&mdash;but edifying, and which have demonstrated
that if Mad. de Genlis was not canonized in her life-time, it was
because there is no longer any religion to speak of, or that she
neglected to cultivate interest with the Pope.
</p>
<p>
One poet had the audacity to put up Madame de Genlis' honour at the
Exchange for a dollar; the ladies of the Directory exclaimed against
this; the Countess herself said nothing: she despised the exaggeration
which nobody could credit. In truth, Madame de Genlis was quite as good
as the particular Queen, whose modesty was only to fall before the
millions of a Cardinal-Duke.
</p>
<p>
Mirabeau boasted, in one of his letters, that he had communicated
his own tenderness to the charming tigress; but Mirubeau was a vain,
good-for-nothing coxcomb, and the boudoir on four wheels which he
presented as the theatre of his triumph, was a horrible invention. The
proof is, that Madame de Genlis says nothing whatever about it in her
Memoirs. Posterity should be just towards the illustrious Countess, and
accept, as sincere, her revelations. Let us, then, consider her as the
most virtuous of women; as the least arrogant; the most sensible; the
most learned; for all, in fine, that she desired to appear; for Madame
de Genlis never said what was untrue; she solemnly declares so.
</p>
<p>
Madame de Genlis had a talent that was very dear to her, but the title
of a good housewife was that she coveted above all the rest. I can never
forget the following circumstance, exemplifying the <i>naîf</i> vanity
of the pretension to be without pretension, which the noble lady
sometimes assumed. I was anxious to see this celebrated person, and
wrote to ask the favour of a brief interview. She appointed the
following day. At twelve o'clock I presented myself;&mdash;Madame de Genlis
was writing; she laid down her pen, and obligingly offered me a seat,
then said&mdash;"Allow me, sir, to finish my <i>pot an feu</i>; above being a
woman of letters, I value myself as a good housewife." And the Countess
scraped the carrots and the leeks, tied them up, put them into the
soup-kettle, skimmed the meat, and neither forgot cloves nor fried
onions. Then taking off her kitchen apron, came with very good grace to
offer herself to my curiosity We talked upon art and literature; and
I must say that she did not speak of her harp more than twice, of her
talent for acting more than once, or of her facility of writing&mdash;very
much more than six times.
</p>
<p>
Madame de Genlis died almost suddenly, and was employing herself as
usual, when death struck her. She leaves two works, which will, no
doubt, be published as soon as a bookseller is found to put them
together, and idlers seem disposed to read them. The King offered her
rooms in the Tuileries, and she had replied to his gracious proposal
the evening before she died.
</p>
<p>
Louis Philip never forgot his preceptor&mdash;Madame de Genlis is said to
have had some desire to be forgotten by her pupil.&mdash;<i>New Monthly

	EXHIBITION OF THE WORKS OF LIVING ARTISTS AT THE BRITISH INSTITUTION,
</h3>
<center>
PALL-MALL.
</center>
<center>
(<i>From a Correspondent.</i>)
</center>
<p>
This attractive Exhibition opened for the season on Monday, the 31st
ult., and contains five hundred and fifty-two works of art. The display
of pictures is certainly very splendid; and, as no portraits are
admitted, the respective artists have employed their talents in
representing pleasing and interesting subjects, some of which contain
high poetical feeling&mdash;while others possess the power of raising our
risibility by their novelty and genuine humour&mdash;a valuable quality in
painting, to attain which, the artist treads an extremely difficult
path. We must now select a few of the most sparkling gems of the
collection.
</p>
<p>
No. 1. Lavinia, from Thomson's Seasons, painted by Sir Martin Archer
Shee, is a chaste production. Lavinia is portrayed as a perfect rustic
beauty.
</p>
<p>
3. A subject from. "The Lost Pleiad" of Miss L.E.L. is beautifully
embodied by Henry Howard, R.A.
</p>
<p>
12. Part of the Corn-market at Caen, formerly the Church of St. Sauveur;
painted by Roberts, in his peculiar and fascinating style.
</p>
<p>
36. The Auld Friends&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
           <p>  "Then here's a fig for snarling time,</p>
<p class="i2">    Wi' features long and grim,</p>
           <p>  Come prime the cup, my gude auld friend,</p>
<p class="i2">    And pledge me brim to brim."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
Painted carefully by J.P. Knight, son of the late comedian.
</p>
<p>
59. Titania, Puck, and Bottom; by Mr. Partridge. This is a commanding
work, and extremely rich in the colouring. The Queen of the Fairies is
represented reposing on a grassy bed, and near her is seated the
formidable Bottom, in his ludicrous metamorphosis: he is placed in such
a situation, that her majesty must see him before any other object when
she <i>awakes</i>. At a little distance Puck is displayed laughing at the
trick he has played on the queen, and seems to anticipate with delight
the amusement that is to ensue.
</p>
<p>
95. Falstaff's Assignation with Mrs. Ford&mdash;from the Merry Wives of
Windsor&mdash;is remarkably delicate in the execution, possesses good
colouring, and is altogether creditable to the painter, Mr. Clint.
</p>
<p>
153. Interior of the Painted Hall. Greenwich Hospital; by John S.
Davis. This is an admirable specimen of rising genius, as it contains
much knowledge of perspective, and great correctness in the distribution
of light and shade.&mdash;Some portraits, and a statue of Nelson, are
judiciously introduced.
</p>
<p>
229. Teniers Painting the Temptation of St. Anthony; executed by
Mr. Fraser, in a masterly manner.
</p>
<p>
447. Mount St. Michael; a magnificent production by Stanfield. The water
is inimitable, possessing that beautiful greenish transparency so
peculiar to the sea.
</p>
<p>
462. The Interior of Mr. Pinney's Gallery, Pall Mall; by Mr.
Novice.&mdash;This is doubtless an arduous undertaking; the artist has
evinced much skill in the arrangement of the various objects of
the piece, and the effect is forcible and good. There is another
representation of a picture-gallery in the exhibition No. 345, but
we think it wants effect.
</p>
<p>
We are sorry that we can <i>only allude</i> to the names of several
other excellent artists. They must not infer, however, that we fail
to appreciate their merits; on the contrary, we would most gladly
appropriate our time to the extension of this notice, were we permitted
sufficient space, for to do ample justice would occupy several pages.
Madame Comolera, Miss E. Drummond, and Miss Hague, deserve attention;
as do Messrs. Clater, Fradelle, Hart, Edmondstone, Chisholme, Deane,
Wilson, Brough, Stanley, Reinagle, and Webster.

	ROYAL EQUIVOQUE.
</h3>
<center>
(<i>From the Life and Reign of George IV.</i>)
</center>
<p>
A well-known individual, some time deceased, who was admitted to the
prince's familiarity upon his first entrance into life, and for several
years after, described or rather dramatized with much humour a scene
which he professed to have had from the prince himself. So much depends
upon tone and manner, that the spirit of these pleasantries evaporates
on paper. The story was in substance as follows:&mdash;A new suit, destined
for a ball that night at Cumberland-house, was brought home to the
prince, but ordered back by him for the purpose of undergoing immediate
alterations. He gave directions that the tailor's return with it should
be instantly made known to him. The prince happened to pass the early
part of the evening with the king and queen at Buckingham-house. Whilst
he was seated in the royal group, a German
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
page entered, and pronounced
in a tone meant for his particular ear, but loud enough to be heard by
every one present, "Please your royal highness, <i>she</i> is come."
There was a moment's awful pause. "Who is come?" said his royal
highness, in a tone between surprise, embarrassment, and anger. "Sir,
<i>she</i> is come," repeated the page, with his bad English and German
phlegm. "Eh! what, what! who is come?" exclaimed the king. "<i>She</i>,
your majesty," reiterated the unmoved German. "She is come!" cried the
queen, bursting with wrath, and supposing that the visiter was one of
the house of Luttrell, who already sought an undue influence over the
prince. All was for a moment inexplicable confusion. The queen summoned
another page, and asked him with fury in her looks, "<i>Who</i> is
<i>she</i> that dares inquire for the Prince of Wales?" "Please your
majesty," said the second oracle, "it is <i>Shea</i>, his royal
highness's tailor."&mdash;<i>Dr. Lardner's Cabinet Library</i>, vol. ii.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>
	THE PRINCE OF WALES AND MRS. FITZHERBERT.
</h3>
<p>
He had now formed an attachment of no common kind to a lady, whose name
at this period came frequently before the public associated with his. A
veil of ambiguity or mystery covered, and still covers, the relations of
the Prince of Wales with Mrs. Fitzherbert. She received all the respect
and exercised all the influence which could belong to rank, character,
accomplishments, and manners, in the highest class of society in this
country daring her intimacy with the prince, and after their separation;
and she is still living, surrounded, in her advanced years, with all the
consideration which could do honour to the decline of a life the most
estimable. Mrs. Fitzherbert was first married at sixteen, and had still
all the graces of beauty and youth on the death of Colonel Fitzherbert.
She was brought up abroad, with every advantage of a costly and
consummate education. Her beauty had that soft and touching character,
the result of fair complexion and blue eyes which distinguishes
Englishwomen abroad, and obtained her the appellation of the angelic
English <i>blonde</i>. The cousin of Lord Sefton, and related to other
distinguished families, she lived in a sphere of society in London which
necessarily made her acquainted with the Prince of Wales. He became
enamoured, declared his passion, and was the cause of her retiring
to the continent to avoid his importunities. Having remained abroad
about three years, she returned to England in 1784. The prince on her
return declared the continuance and repeated the sincerity of his
attachment, with, it would appear, more success. Their intimacy for some
time was known only to the initiated in high life; they moved and met
in the same society, apparently on terms rather of formal than familiar
acquaintance. The secret was divulged shortly before the prince's
quarrel with the king, and base advantage was taken of it to wound the
private feelings of the prince where manly feelings are the most
vulnerable. She was of a Catholic family, herself a Catholic; and this
was easily turned against the Prince of Wales, at a period of religious
bigotry, and political alarm, especially in the mind of George
III.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>
</p>
<hr />
<h3>
	A GREAT SLEEPER.
</h3>
<p>
The Stadtholder, who had recently fled from Holland, was also the
prince's guest, and afforded amusement by the whimsical incongruity
with which he chose his occasions for going to sleep. The princess
commanded a play for his entertainment: in spite of her vivacity
and utmost efforts, he slept and snored in the box beside her, and was
roused with some difficulty when the curtain fell. A ball having been
given in compliment to him at the Castle-tavern, he fell asleep whilst
eating his supper, and snored so loud as to disturb the harmony of the
orchestra and the decorum of the assembly. His Dutch highness was also
entertained, if the term in this instance be admissible, with a grand
masquerade, and was perplexed by the difficulty of resolving in what
dress or character he should attend it. The Prince of Wales said he
might go as <i>an old woman</i>.&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>
	PRIVATE MEMOIRS OF GEORGE III.
</h3>
<p>
It was well known to be the habit of Geo. III. to write in various
folios, for an hour after he rose in the morning. This practice was
not obviously consistent with his want of facility and taste in any
sort of composition; but his manuscripts were only registers of names,
with notes annexed of the services, the offences, and the characters,
as he judged them, of the respective persons. "In addition," says a
publication of 1779 "<i>to the numerous private registers always kept by
the king</i>, and written with his own hand, he has lately kept another,
of all those Americans
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
who have either left the country voluntarily
rather than submit to the rebels, and also of such as have been driven
out by force; with an account of their losses and services." It is
somewhat cruel to lay bare "the bosomed secrets" of any man, even after
the grave has closed upon his passions and weaknesses; but if these
registers of George III. still exist, and should ever come to light,
they will be as curious private memoirs as have ever appeared: they
doubtless promoted the remembrance and compensation of losses and
services; but they also produced his petty long-cherished resentments,
less hurtful to their objects than injurious to his own character and
torturing to his breast.&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
